Use Case
Letâ€™s create a To Do List!


# 1 Basic HTML
First, we need to create a basic HTML to work with:

A text input to write the next element of the list
A button to insert the element into the list
An unordered list to show the To Do list
The Pending Tasks item in the footer will count how many tasks are still to be done.
